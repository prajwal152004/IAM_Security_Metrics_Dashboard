# IAM Security Metrics Dashboard (Simulation)

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates an **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Security Metrics Dashboard** used by security teams to gain visibility into identity-related security data within an organization.

The dashboard focuses on **core IAM metrics** such as high privilege accounts, access violations, role distribution, and overall user visibility.  
It is designed as a **learning and demonstration project**, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and data-driven security insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize organizational users and identity distribution
- Identify and monitor high privilege accounts
- Track and analyze access violations
- Understand role distribution across users
- Present IAM security insights in a simple, intuitive dashboard format

## 🔍 Key Metrics Visualized

### 1. Company People Overview
- Total number of users in the organization
- Department-wise distribution of users
- Provides a high-level identity inventory view

### 2. High Privilege Accounts
- Total number of high privilege users
- Department-wise distribution of privileged accounts
- Helps identify concentration of elevated access

### 3. Access Violations
- Total access violations
- Severity-wise breakdown of violations
- Highlights governance and compliance gaps

### 4. Role Distribution
- Distribution of roles assigned to users
- Helps assess role usage and potential over-privileging

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters
Many IAM-related security issues arise from **lack of visibility rather than lack of controls**.  
This project demonstrates how basic IAM metrics and dashboards can help security teams:
- Understand who has access
- Identify privileged access risks
- Detect governance issues
- Communicate security insights effectively to stakeholders
